### Menu Bar Application Setup

1. **Save the menubar app script:**
   - Make `./setup.sh` executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`
   - Run the script (e.g., `./setup.sh`) to create the `whish.py` script - 
      It will make the script executable and save it to `~/scripts/whish.py`

2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/scripts/whish.py
   ```

3. **Setting up to start automatically:**
   - Open System Settings > General > Login Items
   - Click the "+" button
   - Navigate to your script and add it

4. **Building a standalone app (optional):**
   
   Create a file named `setup.py` in the same directory as your script:
   ```python
   from setuptools import setup

   APP = ['whish.py']
   DATA_FILES = []
   OPTIONS = {
       'argv_emulation': True,
       'plist': {
           'LSUIElement': True,
       },
       'packages': ['rumps', 'pyaudio', 'groq', 'pyperclip', 'pynput'],
   }

   setup(
       app=APP,
       data_files=DATA_FILES,
       options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
       setup_requires=['py2app'],
   )
   ```

   Then build the app:
   ```bash
   python3 setup.py py2app
   ```

   This will create a standalone app in the `dist` folder that you can move to your Applications folder.
