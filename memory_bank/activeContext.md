**Current Focus:** Refactoring codebase for better maintainability

**Recent Changes:**

* Refactored code into modular components:
  - AudioRecorder: Handles all audio recording
  - TranscriptionService: Manages API communication
  - TextInserter: Handles text insertion
* Removed clipboard dependency
* Improved error handling
* Updated documentation

**Next Steps:**

* Test refactored components
* Update README with new architecture

**Active Decisions:**

* Using modular design for better maintainability
* Direct text insertion instead of clipboard
* Separate concerns into dedicated classes
